# test-project

create-react-app
For jump-starting our React apps, we will be largely using create-react-app (available from npm).  To install, run from your terminal:

npm install -g create-react-app@2.0.3
mac/linux users
sudo npm install -g create-react-app@2.0.3

we can test our installations and build a simple test project and concentrate on React and ReactDOM
mkdir test-project
cd test-project
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom

Let's now load React/ReactDOM into an HTML file (see index.html) and verify that our installation is successful.
